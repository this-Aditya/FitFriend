- **Mockk**: Mocking library for testing
- **MockMvc**: Framework for testing controllers and endpoints

FitFriend-API is deployed on Render and can be accessed at [https://fitfriend.onrender.com/](https://fitfriend.onrender.com/). For more information, please refer to the [API documentation](https://github.com/this-Aditya/FitFriend/blob/main/fitfriend-api/README.md). Apologies, for the initial loading time on this API BASE-URL, we are working on upgrading our servers.


## Using the FitFriend API locally with in Android

To use the FitFriend API from your Android application while running the API on your laptop's localhost, you need to follow these steps:

1. Make sure your Android device and laptop are connected to the same network (e.g., Wi-Fi network).

2. Run the FitFriend API:
   - Open the terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the `fitfriend-api` directory.
   - Run the appropriate command to start the Spring Boot API (e.g., `./gradlew build`).

3. Find the IP address of your laptop on the network:
   - On Windows: Open the command prompt and run the command `ipconfig`. Look for the IPv4 Address under the network adapter connected to the network.
   - On macOS or Linux: Open the terminal and run the command `ifconfig`. Look for the IP address under the network adapter connected to the network.

4. Update the API base URL in your Android application code:
   - Open this Android project in your preferred development environment.
   - Update the base url in this directory `app/src/main/java/com/aditya/fitfriend_android/utils/Utils.kt`
   - Replace the existing base URL with the IP address of your laptop, followed by the port number and API endpoint path. For example:
     ```kotlin
     val BASE_URL = "http://192.168.0.100:8080/api/"
     ```

5. Build and run your Android application on your device.

6. Your Android application should now be able to communicate with the FitFriend API running on your laptop's localhost. Ensure that the API endpoints are correctly defined and accessible.

**Note:** If you're using a firewall or antivirus software on your laptop, make sure to allow incoming connections to the API port (e.g., 8080) to ensure the Android device can communicate with the API.

## APK Availability

The APK file for the FitFriend application can be found [**here**](https://github.com/this-Aditya/FitFriend/blob/main/data/app-debug.apk).

## Common Errors and Solutions

- **Error: `CLEARTEXT communication to 192.168.1.33 not permitted by network security policy`**
  - Solution: If you are using HTTP instead of HTTPS in your URL, add the following line to the `AndroidManifest.xml` file within the `<application>` tag:
    ```xml
    android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"
    ```
    This should solve the problem and allow communication with the API.
