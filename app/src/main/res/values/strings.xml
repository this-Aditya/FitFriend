    <string name="description_yoga">Lie on your back with your arms beside you, palms downwards.\nAs you inhale, use your abdominal muscles to lift your feet off the floor, raising your legs vertically at a 90-degree angle.\nContinue to breathe normally and supporting your hips and back with your hands, lift them off the ground.\nAllow your legs to sweep in a 180-degree angle over your head till your toes touch the floor. Your back should be perpendicular to the floor. This may be difficult initially, but make an attempt for a few seconds.\nHold this pose and let your body relax more and more with each steady breath.\nAfter about a minute (a few seconds for beginners) of resting in this pose, you may gently bring your legs down on exhalation.\n</string>
